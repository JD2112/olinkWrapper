This Shiny app provides a user-friendly interface for performing quick analysis of Olink data using [OlinkAnalyze package](https://github.com/Olink-Proteomics/OlinkRPackage). It allows for data upload, parameter customization, visualization of results, and exporting of analysis outputs.

## Data Upload and Merging

NOTE:
- needs to change the separator from `;` to `,`.
- should not be any space in the column name.
- should not any special character or Swedish characters (Ö,Ä,Å) in the column name.

In the sidebar, you'll find three file upload buttons:
  - Upload NPX Data (CSV) - needs to have **SampleID** column
  - Upload Key File (CSV) - needs to have **SampleID** and **SUBJID** columns
  - Upload Variables File (CSV) - needs to have **SUBJID** columns

## How to run locally

### Using R
```
R # laod R >= 4.3.1
library(shiny)
shiny::runApp("app.R")
```

### Using Docker
`docker run --rm -p 3838:3838 jd21/shinyolink:v1.2.1`

### Online webserver
